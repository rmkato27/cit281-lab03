This lab focuses on enhancing JavaScript skills by practicing modern syntax such as refactoring, destructuring, converting functions to arrow functions, utilizing for..in and for..of loops, creating and importing Node.js modules, and using the spread operator.

This really helped me grasp the node.js functionalities because I was able to use it to test my code several times. It makes the running code process much easier for me since you can just type for example, "node lab-03.js" to run the code instead of having to navigate vscode to run and debug my code.
